This library requires the Zlib library in order to do something
usefull. Get it from: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ If you don't have it
already. If you use the attached VC++ workspace files, you must
install the zlib directory into this directory.

At the moment there is no makefile included. I suggest simply
including the source files, and the zlib files into your
current existing makefile.

Use the http://zpp-library.sourceforge.net forums if you need more
information, or contact me directly using email:
